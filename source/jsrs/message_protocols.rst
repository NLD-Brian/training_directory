Message Protocols
==================
There are many formats for messages - the standards for which are laid out on this page. This page starts with the more basic information - such as the NATO phonetic alphabet - and eventually develops into more complex multi transmission messages.

Tactical Reports and Requests will be covered in the next chapters.

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet
--------------------------
The NATO Phoentic Alphabet is used when an alphanumeric character needs to be expressed over the network.

**DISREGARD** – Transmission is in error, disregard

**NOTHING FOLLOWS** – Do not respond to the following transmission

**I SAY AGAIN** – Indicates transmission or portion of a message will be repeated

**INTEROGATIVE** – What follows is a question which should be answered

**MORE TO FOLLOW** – More information will follow the current transmission

**NEGATIVE** – Transmission not acknowledged or cannot comply

**OUT** – Indicates the end of the transmission and no answer is required or expected

**OVER** – Indicates the end of the transmission and a response is necessary

**RELAY (TO)** – Transmit the following message to the indicated stations

**ROGER** – Transmission understood

**PRIORITY** - The following transmission is of elevated importance

**SAY AGAIN** – Request repeat of all or a portion of the last transmission

**THIS IS** – Transmission is originating from the call sign immediately following

**TIME** – Time that follows is the time of the message

**WAIT** – Transmission will pause for a few seconds

Basic Messages
--------------
A Basic Message is used when there is no official SOP for the communication or it is out of routine scope.

 * *“RX, this is TX, MESSAGE, OVER”*
 * *“TX, this is RX, SEND TRAFFIC, OVER”*
 * *“RX, this is TX, MESSAGE blah blah blah, OVER”*
 * *“TX, this is RX, ROGER OVER”*
 
Net Calls
---------
A Netcall is used by a leader - in this example Archer 6 - to establish that his elements are on the network.

 * *“All stations this net, this is Archer 6, respond in sequence, radio check, OVER”*
 * *“This is Archer 1-1, OVER”*
 * *“This is Archer 1-2, OVER”*
 * *“This is Archer 1-3, OVER”*
 * *“All stations this net, this is Archer 6, ROGER, OUT”*

Radio Check
-----------
A Radio Check is used to conduct a check of communication between one or more indicated stations on the net

 * *“(RX), this is (TX), radio check on FREQUENCY, OVER”*
 * *“(TX), this is (RX), ROGER on FREQUENCY, OVER”*
 * *“(RX), this is (TX), ROGER, OUT”*
