Basic Principles of Radio Communication
=======================================

Radio usage in the 1st Rapid Response Force is a complex and disciplined task - however this complexity mainly comes from the amount of communication and not the complexity of individual tasks. At their core radio usage is very simple. Below you will find the major principles explained.

Frequency
----------
A Frequency forms the base of any radio communication. Radio’s work - at a very basic level - by emitting electromagnetic waves which have different oscillation frequencies. By tuning to a frequency the radio is able to receive and transmit on the specified frequency.

  ..Note::
  Military grade radios are significantly more complicated than this and use cryptography and advanced frequency manipulation - however that is not simulated in the game.

Frequencies with very similar wavelengths or certain mathematical relationships between them can interfere with each other so a good comm plan will ensure that frequencies are not overlapping or interfering with each other.

Only one Radio Network can operate per Frequency.

Channels
--------
A Channel is a preprogrammed channel on a radio device that allows for rapid switching to preprogrammed networks. Examples are that Channel 1 might be tuned to 50 and Channel 2 might be tuned to 51. By switching between Channel 1 and Channel 2 the user will be able to change between 50 and 51 faster than typing in the frequency.

**Alternate Channels**

Some radios in the unit will allow for the allocation of an Alternate Channel. An Alternate Channel is a channel that can be operated in addition to the primary channel. This would allow an operator to RX and TX at the same time on two channels from the same radio unit.

Network
--------
A defined use of a given Frequency that is used by a set of Callsigns to communicate with one and other for a designated purpose. For example you might have a command net for communication of High level orders to execution elements, or a fires net for communication with Artillery or IDF elements.

Radio
------
A Radio is an electronic Transceiver that allows for the RX and TX of communications of one or more specified frequencies.

Radio’s come with different length of Atenna and Power Output that will affect their maximum transmission range and the extent to which they are effected by terrain or meteoroligcal interferance. Some radios will also feature advanced functionality such as GPS positioning, Multiple Frequencies ( Alternate Frequency Programming ), Speakers, Stereo Audio Assignment and backlights for operation in low light conditions.

Radio’s in the 1st RRF come in three ratings:

**SCOM Rated**

SCOM ( Short Comm ) rated radio’s are rated for a transmission range of 5KM operating between 50 and 512 MHz with a frequency resolution of 0.1 MHz.

**LCOM Rated**

LCOM ( Long Comm ) rated radio’s are rated for a transmission range of 20 KM and operate between 30 and 87 MHz with a frequency resolution of 0.1MHz.

**AVCOM Rated**

AVCOM ( Aviation Comm ) rated radio’s are rated for a transmission range of 40 KM and can operate between 30 and 87MHz with a frequency resolution of 0.1 MHz.

When provided with a radio by the unit you will always be given its COM rating as well as it’s feature list. If you are not given this information a full list of our radios, their ratings and features can be found in Appendix C - Radio Equipment.

Transmission
------------
A Transmission is a burst of communication sent from one callsign to another on a Frequency. A transmission occurs on a frequency and contains the sender and intended recipient in alongside a corresponding end word - either “Over” or “Out” but never both.

Message
-------
A Message is the contents of a transmission that conveys particular components of information.

Call Sign
---------
A Callsign is a keyword designed to uniquely identify a radio operator on a Network. Callsigns also provide increased OPSEC in the event that communications are compromised as they mask the identity or capabilities of an element.

  ..Note::

  In the 1st RRF we assume that communications are secure at all times and cannot be jeaprodised. This is so that we do not have to deal with cryptographic and frequency rekeys in the event of a radio being lost.

  All radios should still be recovered or destroyed in the gamespace so as to prevent their aquisition by hostile forces - however the 57A team is forbidden from using this to directly listen to or intefere with blufor comms.

Callsigns are assigned in advance by command and will usually follow the unit SOP for radio callsigns found as Appendix A - SOP Call Card.
