An Introduction to Radio Networks in the 1st RRF
================================================

Radio networks are designed to relay time sensitive critical information vertically to command and control elements and horizontally to the adjacent units in order to facilitate the flow of situational awareness and coordinated control of operations.

What is a Radio Network?
------------------------
A Radio Network in the 1st RRF is defined as a radio frequency on which official radio doctrine is used and there is an expectation of brevity and purpose to each transmission.

  ..Note::
  Squad / Element radio frequencies are not counted as Radio Networks under official doctrine. Element leaders will determine the procedures used on these “uncontrolled” networks.

Concepts of Transmission
------------------------

Transmissions on a Radio Network should be CLEAR and CONCISE with clearly stated receiving and sending callsigns in order to accurately convey information to any receiving element in a standardized way. On a Radio Network air time is everything so the shorter you can make your transmission - the better the communication will be.

Radio Networks are single TX ( Transmitter ), multiple RX ( Receiver ) networks - this means that only one person can speak on the network and that voices cannot be seperated or tuned on a given network. This is important as it means that any time you are speaking on a network you are actively preventing anyone else from transmitting on that network.

If elements fail to follow correct radio procedures on a Radio Network they will severely negatively impact the flow of the operations by impeding efficient communication.

Transmission Accuracy is extremely important to tactical radio communication and you should take time to prepare the statements you intend to transmit prior to beginning your broadcast on a given network. By clearly defining your message ahead of time you will use less air time and are less likely to make mistakes during transmission.

Speak Clearly - Radio Networks air time is precious but if you have to say your entire transmission twice then you will use even more of it. This is particularly important for members with heavy regional accents who may need to speak more slowly in order to be understood. Take your time to clearly state your transmission so that you will not need to say it again.

Layered Networks
----------------

In the 1st RRF we use a layered set of networks to mesh a large number of assets concurrently. This means that an individual may be listening to and communicating on multiple radio frequencies.

The resulting layers of frequencies is referred to as the Network Composition which is a complete listing of each channel that will be in use, it’s intended purpose and which callsigns are expected to operate on it.

Command will plan the Network Composition in advance around any present hostile threats or friendly assets that may have overlapping utilization. Whilst this course will teach how to operate in a multi layer radio environment it will not cover how to plan a Composition.
