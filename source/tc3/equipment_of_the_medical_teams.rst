Medical Teams Equipment List
============================
Medical teams are equipped in general with the same equipment as the element they are embedding with except that they carry a lot less ammunition to save weight for medical supplies.

They also wear custom medical backpacks to identify them as medics and are issued berets that they can wear on base to identify them as a specialist trained individual.

Backpacks
---------
Medics are issued at their discretion:
 * Bergen MTP Medic L (A)
 * Bergen MTP Medic L (B)
 * Bergen MTP Medic H (A)
 * Bergen MTP Medic H (B)
 
These MTP Bergen’s come decorated with medical equipment for aesthetics - they do not at this time server a functional purpose although we are working to implement the stretcher.

The backpacks also contain enlarged inventories to fit the additional equipment that medics need to carry.

Weapons and Ammunition Load
-----------------------------
The Medical Teams are issued M4A1 rifles with a short 12” barrel and 5 magazines. This should be sufficient to act in self defence capacities only.

  ..Danger::

  Medics should only discharge their weapon in defence of their own life or that of their patient. They are **not** frontline infantry with medical kits.

Medics also carry a standard sidearm and should not carry a launcher. The OIC of the element that the medical team is attached to can modify their gear list if it is mission appropriate.

Radios
------
Long range radios are not issued to medics.

Medical Equipment
-----------------
All Medics should carry the following medical equipment each - additional supplies ( including blood ) can be carried in vehicles.

More information regarding the use of these materials and the different equipment available at different levels of the pipeline is available in later sections of this training program.

This is a large quantity of medical supplies - of that there is no doubt - and this list applies to EACH medic on the team effectively doubling each field. It is important to note that this two man medical team will be responsible for the field care of approximately 40 personnel.

Basic Medical Equipment

 * 25x Basic Bandages
 * 20x Elastic Bandages
 * 20x Packing Bandages
 * 15x QuikClot
 * 15x Atrophine
 * 25x Epinephrine
 * 25x Morphine
 * 10x Tourniquet
 * 10x Saline 250ml
 * 5x Saline 500ml
 * 2x Saline 1000ml

 
  ..Warning::

  Medics should not carry blood or plasma in the field.

  Blood and plasma require special storage conditions which limit them to only being kept in medical vehicles.

  There is a self imposed simulation on this front and medics should endeavour to keep blood in their vehicles until it is needed.
