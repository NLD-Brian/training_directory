Medical Facility Levels and the Pipeline of Care
================================================

In the RRF we split our medical pipeline into three distinct phases - Care under Fire, Level 1 and Level 2 care.

Below you will find an explanation of each level as well as the transfer between these levels.

Care under Fire
---------------
Care under Fire is the actions undertaken by the squadmates of the injured personnel when a casualty is first injured. This phase revolves solely around bleeding control until such a time that the casualty can be transfered to a trained medical team at a Level 1 care facility.

All infantry personnel are extensively drilled on reacting to injury and the handoff procedures. At the end of the Care under Fire process injured personnel should have been tourniqued and bandaged to the best ability of the element that they belong to. Bleeds will not have been stitched and may reopen. Frontline infantry may have also administered morphine as a pain relief tool or epinehrine if the patient was suffering from a low heart rate.

Level 1 Medical Care
--------------------
Level 1 Medical Care begins when a casualty is received by a medical team at a CCP.

  ..Note::

  A CCP ( Casualty Collection Point ) is an area designated by a platoon leader where a medical detachment should prepare to receive casualties.

  CCPs will generally be somewhat set back from the frontline trace and will routinely be provided with a small security element.

  The purpose of a CCP is to provide a central location for all injured personnel to be triaged and treated by a trained medic or forwarded onto further care. It also serves as a location for collection of dead personnel by Logistics elements.

  When establishing a CCP at a given location medical teams should define a reception point where casualties are received and triaged as well as a treatment area where casualties are given aid.

  This information should then be marked on the map so that other elements know how to work efficiently with the medical team at the CCP.

Infantry personnel will hand over casualties at the designated triage area of the CCP and provide the medic with:

	* **Any aid rendered**
	* **Casualty Roster Number and Element**
	* **Cause of injury**
	* **Time of handoff (Local Time)**
	
**Medical personnel should then physically note this information in real life on paper as it is important to keep track of casualties who may be potentially MIA or non responsive.**

Once a casualty is received from the infantry the medic will triage the casualty into one of four categories:

	* **GREEN** Clear for discharge from the CCP. No active bleeds ( all have been stitched ) with a good blood volume and stable pulse. Able to effectively fight.
	* **YELLOW** Requires medical attention at a non life threatening level. All wounds have been bandaged but have not been stitched. May be low on fluid and attached to an IV. Not cleared for discharge but does not require active medical attention.
	* **RED** Requires urgent medical attention to stabilise and will require MEDEVAC. Casualty may have suffered cardiac arrest, severe bleeding and extreme loss of blood volume. The medical team will attempt to stabilize the casualty for MEDEVAC.
	* **BLACK** The casualty is dead. All medical aid will cease and the casualty is treated as a logistical issue from this point forward.
	
  ..Danger::

  **WE DO NOT LEAVE BODIES BEHIND. DEAD PERSONNEL MUST ALL BE RECOVERED ALONGSIDE WOUNDED PERSONNEL.**

Medics will prioritize casualties based on their colour code dealing with the most severe first.

Medical teams have autonomy in the way that they run the CCP however the official recommendation is that one member of the team provides Triage whilst the other renders aid. This is because triage is a constant process of monitoring bleeding, Pulse and Blood Pressure for all personnel in the CCP in parrallel to the time intensive task of rendering aid is performed.

  ..Note::

Medical personnel can request that teammates dropping off wounded personnel remain behind to render CPR if necessary. **Medical personnel should not commit to performing CPR themselves unless absoloutely necessary - always try to seek outside assistance**

Performing a MEDEVAC
--------------------
It is the sole decision of the senior medic if a casualty requires a MEDEVAC. If a MEDEVAC is called the medic should provide the necessary information for the five line to the platoon leader for relay.

The platoon leader will then liase with command or follow preestablished guidelines for the evacuation of casualties. The leader will then relay this information back to the medical team as they receive it.

  ..Danger::

  **MEDICAL PERSONNEL SHOULD NOT CALL AIRCRAFT OR ASSETS DIRECTLY - THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE TRANSMISSIONS AND ASSISGNMENTS**

At this stage the platoon leader will advise if the MEDEVAC will be land or air based and any steps required to comply as well as an ETA.

Detailed below are the procedures to follow for a land and air based MEDEVAC.

**Land Based MEDEVAC**

A Land Based MEDEVAC is conducted by a medical team on the ground with an ambulance.

The Medical team at the CCP should prepare the casualty for transport. This might include ensuring that bleeding has been well controlled and that a fresh IV is in place if necessary.

The Medical team should then prepare to move the casualty if he is unconcious or clearly communicate the steps with the casualty if they are ambulatory.

Once the ambulance arrives the medic will dismount the MEDEVAC vehicle and conduct a handoff identical to that performed when receiving a casualty at the CCP. He will then load the casualty into the vehicle or provide them with instructions to board the vehicle.

Once all casualties are loaded the MEDEVAC vehicle will return to base. During the journey the medic on duty ( the one that is not driving the vehicle ) will constantly monitor all casualties and administer any aid possible. As this is a vehicle it will also be possible to perform a blood transfusion.

Once at base the ambulance will pull into the Level 2 facility and the casualty will be handed over.

  ..Note::

  In some cases the MEDEVAC team will act as the Level 2 facility. In this case they should take the casualty inside the facility and use a Personal Aid Kit.

**Air Based MEDEVAC**

An air based MEDEVAC is conducted by a medical team embedded within a transport airframe. Air based MEDEVACs are more complicated than land based MEDEVACs as they must comply with the additional complications of aviation cooperation.

Similar to a land based MEDEVAC the CCP team should prepare the casualty for MEDEVAC and get them moved to an area close to the HLZ.

Once the aircraft lands the flight medics will disembark and perform a handoff for each casualty. The Flight Medics alone will load the casualties into the helicopter. **Flight Medics are specially trained on loading casualties without damaging the aircraft - CCP personnel should not approach the aircraft.**

Once all casualties are loaded the Flight Medics will load up and give an all clear signal to the Airframe Crew who will then take off and begin a return flight to base.

  ..Note::

  MEDEVAC flights get the highest Air Traffic Control priority second only to MAYDAY calls so you should not spend a long time in flight in most cases.

During the flight the medical crew in the back of the aircraft will do their best to stabilize the patientâ€™s by providing blood transfusions and chemcial injections.

In some cases the flight crew may also assist with providing CPR to the casualties in flight.

Upon landing the patients will be handed over to Level 2 care as per the land based MEDEVAC.

Level 2 Medical Care
---------------------
Level 2 Medical Care in the 1st RRF is a facility equipped with basic surgical equipment. In the context of the game this means that Personal Aid Kits can be used within the building which allows a wounded individual to be restored to full health.

Level 2 facilities are not active deployment positions and are filled by off duty medical personnel from around the unit. In some cases MEDEVAC personnel may need to act as the Level 2 doctor as well.
