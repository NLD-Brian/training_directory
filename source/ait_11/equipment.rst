Equipment of the Infantry
=========================
During BCT you have been introduced to the spectrum of weapons used throughout the unit. In this program you will be given the chance to shoot all of the weapons used in the infantry.

At the end of this AIT program you will be qualified to carry all of the weapons listed below with the possible exception of the HK417 which is only available if you graduated BCT with a high enough rifle range score.

Weapons of the Infantry
-----------------------
M4A1 ( with optional ELGM module )
M249 PARA
HK417

Clothing in the Infantry
------------------------
A uniform dress code is important to us for maintaining a consistent and realistic look across our ground forces.

The standard issue combat uniform is the TFA NWU2/3 (AOR 1 / AOR 2 respectively in some modpacks) with rolled or unrolled sleeves.

We issue FAST helmets for MOUT and Boonie Hats for patrols. All soldiers must carry a FAST helmet on their person at all times but may also carry a boonie hat if they wish.

We issue TFA plate carriers in either NWU2, NWU3, Tan or Foliage.

Finally we issue TFA Assualt packs in NWU2, NWU3, Tan or Foliage for infantry and TFA Caryalls for Medics in the same camoflauge sets. CLF radio backpacks in Tan or Foliage are available to leadership positions.

Communication and Navigation Equipment
--------------------------------------
All members of the infantry are issued with the AN/PRC 343 short range radio which they should use to communicate with their squad and in some cases their fire team.

All personnel are also issued with the DAGR GPS navigation system for waypoint based navigation and positional location. Members also carry a Map, a Compass, a Watch and a map light for night time use.
