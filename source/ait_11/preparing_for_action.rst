Preparing for a Mission
=======================
Getting started on a mission in the RRF can be confusing at first and this can sometimes lead to delays.

To help everyone get into playing the game faster this section will teach you how to efficiently retrieve your equipment and get ready for your mission.

Retrieving your Equipment from the Armourer
-------------------------------------------
At the start of a mission you will login to the server. Assuming you are not already deployed in the field on that server then you will be spawned at base with a stripped down load out.

You should immediately report to the Armourer and request your load out that has been generated for you based on your web load out preferences.

Once you are done retrieving your equipment from the Armourer, you should return the box to the armorer using the ACE interaction key in order to keep the area clean for the next team moving through.

Finally you should report to the Logistics Facility to retrieve Ammunition, Medical Supplies and Disposable Equipment such as Explosives, Cable Ties and Smoke Grenades.

  ..Danger::

  When loading out you may be tempted to attempt to carry more magazines than you are permitted to carry. This will not only harm your squad mates who will not have enough magazines, it will also have severe consequences if you are found out for it.

  The punishment for being caught with intentionally over capacity ammunition at the time of mission commencement is a Verbal Counseling statement with the Unit Commander, if the act happens a second time you will receive a (NCS) Negative Counseling Statement on your personnel file. Further violations lead to demotion, reassignment, and even discharge from the unit.

  We take our simulation environment very seriously however, we must rely on player honesty to implement some constraints to the system. Hence we rely on players to take their allowed ammunition and strongly look down on violations of this trust.

Setting up your Radio
---------------------
Once you have successfully picked up all your required equipment you should move to the staging area that your squad leader has marked.

Here you should set your radio to the correct frequency and wait for your squad leader to perform a radio check.

We detail more about this procedure in the next chapter.

Buddy Check
-----------
You should perform an equipment check with your Battle Buddy before departing.

This consists of you running down the list of equipment your buddy will need for the mission with your battle buddy whilst he verifies that he has all of the mentioned equipment.
