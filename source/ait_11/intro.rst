Infantry is the backbone of all operations undertaken by the 1st RRF. With this vital role comes a responsibility and requirement to fight effectively and as a team. If the infantry fail, the team fails - all other assets exist to support the infantry.

This AIT program is designed to teach you the common basics shared by all of our infantry forces from a regular Rifleman all the way to a Special Forces Operator. Once you complete this program you can apply for positions in the various infantry units and also take part in the various AIT II programs on offer such as Medical and Airborne training.

This manual is split into 9 sections of content - only some of which will be covered during in game training. It is therefore important that you ask any questions raised from the material to other unit members so that you form a good understanding of our systems.
