An Introduction to the 1st Rapid Response Force
===============================================
Welcome to Basic Training. During this course, you will learn the essential techniques and tactics required to function as a member in the unit.

The 1st RRF is a large and complex group, with many roles and functions that operate concurrently. We greatly appreciate your interest in becoming a member of our Unit and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your involvement.

It is important to note before proceeding that this group is not a perfect replica of military practise. It is regardless one of the most realistic simulation units in the game, however we are aware where we have deviated from Military Doctrine. This means that arguing that you are doing something correctly according to the military is not a cover for insubordination. An example of this might be using British rank names or calling things by USAF designators instead of the 1st RRFs.

How Training Works in the 1st RRF
---------------------------------
The BCT course is split into four sections, each of which covers a different aspect of your training. Each section has a video and a written passage, both of which you should study carefully in advance of your training session. Failure to read through the material may result in your instructor failing you from the course, which would delay or in some cases block your entry to the unit. If you fee that you require additional time to learn for the class, you may speak to your assign instructor in advance about delaying your practical training session to give you more time.

Every course in the 1st RRF contains sections, which contain a video and written material. For simple courses, such as BCT, these sections will all be covered in a single in game session. However for more advanced courses, such as Special Forces or Medics, the course may be spread over several in game sessions. This information will be clearly noted in the Training Centre. If you wish to learn more about a given course, you should contact your Chain of Command or talk to an Officer over Private Mail.

Rank in the 1st RRF
-------------------
In the RRF, our promotion system is based on an adaption of real life. It uses a system based on three factors, your position, your time in grade and your promotion points.

Ranks are limited by the position you occupy. If you wish to reach the highest ranks, you must accept higher levels of leadership, responsibility or specialisation. In the event that you decide to move back to a position with a lower rank cap than your current rank, you will be capped at the rank of the position. Upon moving to a higher capped rank, your rank will be restored to its normal level, with no time on grade credit.

Promotion points are earned for attendance of events and training programs. Promotions points can also be removed for failing to attend events you have committed to and for negative disciplinary action.

Time in Grade is the time since your last promotion. This means that to reach high ranks you must remain with the RRF for an extended period of time. Many of our members have been in the group for years; We are not a short term commitment.

Operations and Gameplay in the 1st RRF
---------------------------------
**Operational Deployments**

We schedule our operations very differently to other units. Most units have regular play times every week or every other week.

In the RRF we schedule deployments, that work on a five week basis with two weeks of advance notice for individual elements.

A deployment starts with a two weeks of notice period where we provide all of the times you would be playing during that deployment. You can accept or decline the deployment based on whether your schedule will fit.

Once this two week process is complete the element moves to a training week wherein the team leader will run the squad through drills and procedures that may come in handy during their deployment together.

Once the training week is completed the element will deploy to the AOR for 3 weeks completing regular operations in the battlespace.

Finally, once their tour of the battlespace is over, the element will be given a week off where they can play other games and really do anything they want.

This unique system offers us versatility and dedication unlike any other group without being overly restrictive on individuals who have very little time.

**Chain of Command**

We operate a unique style of chain of command, where officers play a less central role on the ground than in other units. In the RRF, officers are there to organise paperwork and macroscopic actions, whereas NCOs will organise combat actions.

Finally, we operate a unique system of on call assets. Examples include Artillery, Air Support, Logistics and MEDEVAC capabilities. This unique system means that if these elements are required, personnel marked as on call will receive a phone call and text message, with a in game response time of circa ten minutes. This unique ability means that all of our assets are provided by real players, adding a genuine and authentic feel to the gameplay.
