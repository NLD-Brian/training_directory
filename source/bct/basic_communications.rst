Introduction to the Buddy Team
==============================
In the RRF, all combat actions are undertaken by a minimum of two people. Individuals should never act alone and can receive disciplinary action for moving as an individual instead of as a team. The RRF holds team play above everything else and do not take kindly to lone wolves. Even the best Special Operations elements in our unit operate in pairs at the least.

There are two key concepts when working as a two man team. The first is Communication, the second is tactics. Both of these require that everyone is on the same page in terms of definitions and tactics.

Buddy Communications
--------------------
Contact Report

	The first thing that you should be able to communicate to your buddy is contact. We do this using a system called the three Ds. Distance, Direction and Description. This means that when receiving or directing fire you should clearly announce “12 O’Clock, 300 metres, light infantry squad.” or “Bearing 300, by the bridge, one tank”. This format is standard across the unit and should always be used to report contact. You should not attempt to abbreviate or abridge this format.

**Ammunition Casualties Equipment (ACE) Report**

	The second thing to communicate is your status. To do this we use a colour coded system called an ACE report. This works by using three colours to represent Ammunition, Casualties / Medical status and Equipment in that order.

	The colours are as follows:

	**Green** 100% Ammunition / No Casualties or Injuries / No Equipment missing

	**Yellow** 50% Ammunition / Minor Injuries / Equipment missing but still combat effective

	**Red** 20 % Ammunition / Major Injuries / Equipment low risking being ineffective

	**Black** 0% Ammunition / Death / No Equipment

Buddy Tactics
-------------
Small Team Tactics form the backbone of the RRF’s operations. No matter how many elements are involved in an operation; within each element is a unique set of small team tactics being executed. Making sure that everyone in the unit is aware of these tactics helps us to work and play together as a team.

In this course you will be taught two very basic buddy team maneouvers:

  * Talking Guns
  * The Buddy Team Bound
  
**Talking Guns**

	This maneouver involves the two members of the fireteam alternating their shots to increase the amount of time that they can supress a target without an interruption in fire rate.

	When the instructor say to begin this excercise the recruits should assume the prone position on the firing mats and begin to alternate their shots. This will consist of one recruit firing one shot, then waiting for the other to fire and so on and so forth.

	Once the magazine of the first shooter is depleted he will conduct a reload whilst the second recruit provides ongoing suppresive fire.

	The excercise will end when the instructor calls “Cease Fire”

**The Buddy Team Bound**

	The Buddy Team bound is a maneouver that allows a buddy team to close the distance between themselves and an active enemy contact whilst maintaining suppresing fire on the enemy.

	This maneuver is undertaken by the first team member firing on the target whilst the second advances forward by approximately 15 metres. At this point the second recruit will assume the prone, begin firing on the target, then communicate to his teammate that he is “Set”.

	At this time the first recruit will proceed to sprint forward 15 metres - reloading during his run. Once he has advanced he will assume the prone and signal to his battle buddy that he is “Set”.

	The excercise will continue in this fashion until the team has reached the contact at which time the training instructor will make the “Cease Fire” call.
