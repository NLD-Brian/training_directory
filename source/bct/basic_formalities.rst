Basic Formalities
=================
As a strict MILSIM unit we believe that there is value to the meta game that MILSIM provides - however we also understand and acknowledge our role as a gaming community where people come to relax.

As such we have a system of formalities which must be obeyed that are designed to maintain mutual respect and courtesy without imposing unnecessary restraints on casual recreation.

Formalities in game are taken very seriously in this group and as such it is important that you understand the items detailed in this training and obey them in the appropriate environments.

Teamspeak and Courtesies
------------------------
**Joining a Room**

When joining a teamspeak channel you must announce that you have joined this channel. When joining the channel you should state both your rank and name.

When a member joins a channel and identifies themselves no further action is required for most members. The only exception to this rule is Officers ( this does not include Warrant Officers ).

If an officer joins a channel any member of the channel should call the room to attention by saying “Room - attention!”. This should mean all conversations stop until the officer grants an “At Ease” call. Failure to respect an attention call upon an officer joining a channel is cause for disciplinary action.

**Use of Rank**

In any formal channel - for example an office - we expect that rank will be used as the means of address instead of names.

The sole exception is that officer’s may address each other by first name when in private.

**CAC Card and Name Format**

We require that member’s name’s be formatted correctly at all times and their CAC card be displayed as their teamspeak avatar. The CAC card can be downloaded from our website under your Virtual Personnel File.

.. note::

  The Official Name Format

  NAME: First Last

  FORMAT IN TS: LAST.F

  The system will automatically add your rank and clan tags from there.

Room Access and Usage
---------------------
In Teamspeak we have a large number of rooms to cater to the large number of elements that make up our combined arms task force.

You should not idle in these rooms as they are for focused discussion and conversation regarding that element’s activities. They should not be used for general gaming or conversation and misuse is a disciplinary offence.

We provide the Freedom Bar for conversations relating to assorted topics as well as a few lounges for different conversations or games to proceed.

You should not enter another element’s channel without a member of that element present and without notifying someone in the channel first.

Security Clearances
-------------------
Security Clearances in the 1st RRF are used to denote how much that individual knows about the RRF’s mission environment at any given time. This is primarily used to maintain order and discipline as well as seperation of concerns.

Given the huge amount of effort that goes into each campaign and the four month lifespan of a campaign we take this very seriously to help prevent spoilers or game breaking effects.

Room Clearnaces mean that room is safe to discuss information at the following classification levels:

No Clearance

  Talk only about your experience of the operations that have previously occured. Do not share any information that is marked as classified as it is normally designed to be an internal document. The only individuals without clearance are potential recruits and public players so it is important we present a unified and clean facing image to the wider ARMA community.

Classified

  Classified is the lowest level of clearance and is afforded to all members of the 1st RRF. It means you are free to read through OPORDs and other material related to your purpose in the game space. It also allows you to discuss other missions undertaken by elements with a similar clearance level.
Secret

  Secret means that you can discuss all activited in the gamespace, including those undertaken by Command, Reconaissance and Special Operations teams. This is classically used to shield long form or confusing content that might cause confusion, morale degradation or drama if it were to be more widely distributed.

Top Secret

  This means you are free to discuss the behind the scenes of the mission including the ultimate stories and practical implementation details.

  It is only possesed by the 57A team and the Unit Commander.

In Game Formalities
-------------------
**Uniform and Dress Code**

Uniforms are managed through the Virtual Loadout Editor.

Combat Uniforms will be issued by higher and vary, but are generally based on NWU2 and NWU3 by TFA.

When on home base you are expected wear homebase uniform. This is a TRYK AOR1 or AOR2 trouser with a tan, black or green sweater. You will be introduced to this uniform during BCT by your instructor.

  .. warning::

  The RRF conduct all official business in game including meetings and promotion boards at our Wake Island home base facilities.

  Primary Weapons and equipment should not be carried on home base unless at a firing range - Doing so is cause for disciplinary action.

**Rank Use**

Ranks should only be used on home base and not in a deployment environment.

**Salutes and Attention**

Any senior ranking individual may call a formation to attention assuming all members of the formation are of a lower rank.

At this time all members of the formation should salute the individual calling attention until an at ease call is given.

**Accidental Discharges**

Discharging a weapon on base accidently is cause for disciplinary action and may result in a suspension in service depending on the severity of the occurance. Blaming glitches in the game is not a good enough excuse when we provide safety switches.

**Fratricide**

Fratricide is forbidden on any 1st RRF asset at any time under any circumstance. Fratricide will result in an automatic Article 15 on any offender with punishment decided by the Unit Commander in line with the disciplinary guidelines.

  .. danger::

  **We do not play soft ball when it comes to fratricide of any kind. It completely undermines our environment - this includes mercy killing ( glitches, animation issues ) and euthanasia ( “he asked for it” ).**

  **If you suffer an issue requiring a teammate to respawn contact a member of the 57A team or the officer on duty in the TOC at the time.**

  **Fratricide is the fastest way out of this unit second only to internal recruiting.**
