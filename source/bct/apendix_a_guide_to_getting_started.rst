Apendix A - Your first week in the RRF
======================================
Congratulations on completing your basic training course! You are now a valued member of our group and we are glad to have you!

We know how daunting it can seem when joining a large group and we want to do everything we can to help you get off to a great start. To assist you with that we have put together this list of five things you should do during your first week in the unit:

**Apply to an AIT 1**

	AIT 1 is your gateway to joining us on Operations. Selecting a specialization is a big part of enjoying your time in the RRF but don’t worry - you are able to cross train and switch MOS should you not enjoy the one you pick.

	AIT is the most rewarding training program we offer as it helps to train you in the actual tactics we use to accomplish objectives and helps you to become part of your first squad.

**Meet the Theatre Commander**

	The Unit Commander does not normally meet with lower ranking individuals for matters that are anything other than disciplinary. However you should know who is calling the shots of the group you just joined.

	To help you get a feel for the group you can arrange a time to meet with the Theatre Commander by messaging 2LT. Striker on the website messaging system.

**Play on the Public Server**

	Playing on the public server is a great way to meet your new team mates and find some friendly faces within the group.

	Everyone is interested in seeing the RRF grow and prosper so everyone will be open to meeting and talking to you. Just be careful about your timing, approaching some of the higher ranking members out of the blue might not always end well.

**Be Modest and Respectful**

	Boasting about how great your life is or how inferior everyone else is to you is an easy way to become hated - avoid it if you don’t want to be mocked until you cry.

	Some people can take it, most can’t. Don’t be a dick and you won’t have to put up with it.

**Be active on Teamspeak**

	A lot of new members think that we will tell them when and where to be - however a lot of the RRF is about helping you to achieve your aims.

	Noone is going to handhold you through it unless you are actively engaged yourself. By spending time in teamspeak regularly you will receive helpful advice and tips on progressing in the unit!
