Welcome to 1st Rapid Response Force - Training Directory

About the Training Directory
=================================================

The Training Directory stores all of the 1st RRFâ€™s training programs in an easily searchable and referancable way.

This area is designed to provide the training materials that should be used in partnership with our in game training programs. These documents are important for learning the base information required for each school but are not comprehensive in every case and as such complement the practical training rather than replacing it.

We welcome other units to get in touch with us if they wish to train their troops to our standards - we will gladly provide support and assistance with that as it is mutually beneficial to have our forces compatibly cross trained.

=================================================
About our Game Environment
=================================================

The 1st RRF uses a highly modified and custom gamespace that is unique to our unit. This fully persistent and simulated battlespace relies on a large number of custom built internal mods and as such some sections of this training may reference functions or features which the reader has not seen in ARMA before.

We work hard to ensure that these training documents are always in line with the latest production features offered on our servers so as to prevent confusion.

Other units using this training program may wish to contact us so that they can train or play in our environment. We welcome any units that wish to share our modpack and gamespace; Any contact request related to this should be directed to the Unit Commander by emailing: info@korps-mariniers.com
