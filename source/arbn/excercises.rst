Training Session
================
The Airborne training session takes between one and two hours depending on the size of the class and the speed at which trainees pick up the knowledge.

The session will require you to demonstrate an understanding of all of the skills detailed in this manual and show that you have understood the basic procedures that we follow during an Airborne insertion.

The session will start with the aircraft on the ground and a walking pace run through of the procedures. You will also be taught how to use the ACE system in the context of a parachute jump to correctly interact with your parachute and equipment.

Your instructor will also introduce you to the equipment loadout used by Airborne infantry and help you to select the correct equipment in the online loadout editor.

Next you will take part in two practice jumps before a final qualification jump for a total of three jumps. One of these practices jumps will take place at night and will require that you are able to operate your night vision effectively and use visual markings to safely land in the drop zone.

  ..Warning::

  To pass this course you must correctly execute all three jumps including the practice jumps without commiting a safety violation.

  The qualification jump is no more or less important than the practise jumps apart from it is expected to be executed at full speed as opposed to reduced speed of the practice jumps.
