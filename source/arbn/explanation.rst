Important Roles in an Airborne Jump
===================================
Airborne jumps are complex maneouvers using moving parts from across the spectrum of 1st RRF forces.

This serves as an introduction to these roles so you can understand the moving parts going on around you.

**Jump Masters**

	Each aircraft will have two nominated jump masters.

	The jump master is in control of all personnel from the time they stage to board the aircraft to the time they exit the aircraft. They will give commands, ensure safety and manage the jump through coordination with the aircraft crew and relevant ground and logistic elements.

	  ..Danger::

	  Listen and obey the Jump Master at all times. Failure to do so will result in a course failure for a Safety Violation.

	In this course the Jump Masters will be your primary instructors however during combat operations jump master role will be assumed by the leadership within your element.

	Jump Master certification is provided as part of the Infantry NCO development program and is not covered by this course.

**Aircraft Logistics Specialist**

	The Aircraft Logistic Specialist is the member of the Logistics and Air Traffic Control ground team responsible for safely escorting you to the staging position for the aircraft and ensuring that all personnel have safely boarded.

	He will be wearing an orange vest and should be listened to at all times. In most situations the ALS will only interact with the Jump Masters however you should still be aware of his presence and role.

**Loadmaster**

	The Loadmaster is the member of the Aircraft crew assigned to manage the personnel inside the aircraft and ensure cooperation between the pilots and the Jump Masters.

	He is ultimately responsible for the safety of all on board and will ensure that everyone has exited.

	**The Loadmaster is exclusively responsible for opening and closing the aircraftâ€™s ramps and doors. You should not attempt to interact with the aircraft.**
