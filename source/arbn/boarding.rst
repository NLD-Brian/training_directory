Boarding the Aircraft and Moving to the DZ
==========================================
During this phase of the training, we will cover how to load the aircraft and what will happen during movement to the drop zone.

  ..Note::

  When troops are inserted by Airborne jump the landing area is reffered to as a Drop Zone (DZ) as opposed to a Landing Zone (LZ) used in most other aviation contexts.

Loading the Airframe
--------------------
When you have equipped your parachute and formed into two ranks, the Aviation Logistics Specialist and Loadmaster will pass control to the jump master. From this point on, he is in charge of all actions until you leave the aircraft. The logistics team will clear each file to approach the aircraft in series to prevent glitches that occur during simultaenous boarding. The jump master will instruct you to take a knee, then he will coordinate with the aircraft crew for loading procedures.

When the aircraft crew indicates it is clear to load, the jump master will instruct you to stand up and move past him up the ramp and into the aircraft. You will use your scroll wheel while looking at the inside of the side doors to load as a passenger. Do not worry if you are sitting on the wrong side when you load; you will be given instruction during the pre-jump phase on assuming the appropriate side for the jump.

Once all personnel are loaded, the jump master will then give the all clear to the loadmaster and they will begin taxi, take off and movement. Upon approaching the Drop Zone, at which time a call will be sent to the jumpmaster, you will remain silent on both verbal and radio communications. This is to ensure that the jump master can communicate with the aircraft crew and to prevent confusion.

At this point Pre Jump procedures are undertaken.
