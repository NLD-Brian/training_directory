Rallying at the RP
==================
Once you land you need to regroup at the predesignated Rally Point (RP) so that you can proceed with the rest of the operation.

Prior to the jump your leadership will have marked a primary, secondary and fallback RV for you to use. The Jump Masters will have clarified the RV points before boarding the airframes, but it is up to you to correctly navigate to the RV and make link up with your team.

  ..Note::

  You should get clear of the DZ as soon as possible so that the area is clear for further troop landings.

Moving away from the DZ to the RV
---------------------------------
Before moving you should take off your parachute and use the ACE key to reequip your rucksack that was previously attached to your front.

Immediately move to the rally points in order of priority. If a Rally Point is compromised or unsuitable, attempt to contact your element to notify your leader of the situation and proceed to the next LZ in the list.

If you are unable to clear the Drop Zone due to injury, enemy contact or adverse terrain seek cover and concealment if available and attempt to contact your leadership for assistance.
